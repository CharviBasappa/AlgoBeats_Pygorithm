### Sorting Algorithm Summaries
1. Bubble Sort
   Repeatedly compares adjacent items and swaps them if out of order.
2. Insertion Sort
   Builds a sorted portion by inserting one element at a time in the correct position.
3. Selection Sort
   Repeatedly selects the smallest/largest from unsorted part and swaps.
4. Merge Sort
   Divide and conquer algorithm: splits list, recursively sorts, then merges.
5. Quick Sort
   Picks a pivot, partitions into less/greater lists, then sorts recursively.
6. Heap Sort
   Builds a heap (binary tree), repeatedly extracts max/min.
